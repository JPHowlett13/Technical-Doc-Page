       <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It is the backbone of all web pages, providing the structure and content displayed in a web browser.</p>
        <p>HTML is essential for web development, forming the foundation upon which CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript are added to enhance the design and interactivity of web pages.</p>

         <p>Listed are the key aspects of HTML</p>
         <ul>
          <li>
            Markup Language: HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to annotate and define elements within a document. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g.<code>&lt;tagname&gt;</code>).
          </li>
          <li>
            Elements and Tags: HTML documents are made up of various elements, each defined by a start tag (e.g. <code>&lt;p&gt</code>) and an end tag (e.g., <code>&lt;&#47;p&gt;</code>). Some elements are self-closing, such as <code>&lt;img &#47;&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>
            Body: HTML provides the structural foundation of a web page. It includes elements for headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and more. The body is typically nested, meaning elements can contain other elements.</li>
          <li>
            Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element. For example, an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag can have an "href" attribute that specifies the URL of the link: <code>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;&#47;a&gt;</code>.</li>
          <li>
           Structure: The basic structure of an HTML document consists of the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> Declaration that defines the document type and version of HTML. <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> The root element of an HTML document.The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets. The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> Sets the title of the document, shown in the browser's title bar or tab.Lastly, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other media.</li>

        <p> HTML and CSS are two fundamental technologies used together to create and design web pages. While they serve different purposes, their relationship is complementary and essential for modern web development.</p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls the visual appearance of web pages, making it possible to style and lay out content in various ways and is a powerful tool for web designers and developers, enabling them to create visually appealing, consistent, and responsive web pages by separating the visual presentation from the HTML content.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="CSS_Structure"><header>CSS Structure</header>
     <article>
       <p>The main structure of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is based on rulesets that define how HTML elements should be styled and displayed. These rulesets consist of selectors and declarations, organized in a way that allows for easy and efficient styling of web pages.</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Selectors: Used to target the HTML elements that you want to style. There are several types of selectors:</li>
       <ul>
          <li class="li2">Element Selector: Targets all instances of a specific HTML element.</li>
          <li class="li2">Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.</li>
          <li class="li2">ID Selector: Targets an element with a specific id attribute.</li>
          <li class="li2">Attribute Selector: Targets elements with a specific attribute.</li>
          <li class="li2">Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements: Target elements based on their state or position.</li>
       </ul>
         <li>Ruleset: A CSS ruleset is composed of a selector and a declaration block. The declaration block contains one or more declarations, each ending with a semicolon.</li>
         <li>Comments: CSS comments are used to add notes or explanations within the stylesheet. Comments are ignored by browsers and do not affect the styles.</li>
         <li>Media Queries: Used to apply styles based on the viewport size or other media features, enabling responsive design.</li>
        </ul>
